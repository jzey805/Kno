**Kno** is a minimalist AI Knowledge Internalization Engine. It moves beyond simple "bookmarking" to solve the digital "link graveyard" problem by transforming chaotic signals—URLs, PDFs, and voice memos—into structured, audited, and internalized wisdom.
Built for the Google Gemini API Developer Competition, Kno leverages the multi-model reasoning capabilities of the Gemini 3 ecosystem to create a spatial cognitive environment for the modern researcher.

## 🧠 The Philosophy
Traditional productivity tools focus on **storage**. Kno focuses on **internalization**.
We believe that data is only useful if it is challenged, synthesized, and remembered. Kno acts as a cognitive partner that doesn't just save what you read—it forces you to think about it through adversarial auditing and spatial mapping.

## ✨ Core Features

**1. Neural Ingestion (The Feed)**
Capture high-velocity signals from anywhere.
- **Web Distillation**: Instant extraction of core insights from URLs using Search Grounding.
- **Multimodal Capture**: OCR for handwritten notes, screenshots, and complex PDF data extraction.
- **Neural Dump**: A "God Mode" input engine using the **Gemini Live API** to process real-time voice streams and visual frames simultaneously.

**2. Logic Guard (The Critic)**
Powered by **Gemini 3 Pro** with a dedicated **Thinking Budget**, Kno performs a "Trinity Audit" on every note:
- **Factual Accuracy**: Cross-referencing claims against real-time data.
- **Cognitive Balance**: Identifying confirmation bias, echo chambers, and skewed perspectives.
- **Logical Integrity**: Scanning for formal fallacies and structural flaws in arguments.

**3. Spatial Synthesis (The Canvas)**
A D3-powered infinite workspace where ideas interact physically.
- **The Collider**: Force-fuse two conflicting ideas to generate a new synthesis.
- **The Alchemy Engine**: Transform raw source notes into structured "Gold" assets.
- **Serendipity Sparks**: AI-driven discovery of non-obvious connections between disparate nodes in your library.

**4. Memory Lab (Forensics)**
Track the health of your "Second Brain" with predictive analytics.
- **Decay Prediction**: AI calculates your retention probability based on quiz performance and time elapsed.
- **Forensic Audits**: Deep scans to identify "memory gaps" and logical inconsistencies across your entire library.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Dynamic, AI-generated quizzes that evolve as you learn.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
Kno utilizes a sophisticated multi-model pipeline to balance speed and reasoning depth:
**System**   	   **Gemini Model**	          **Technical Implementation**
**Ingestion** 	   gemini-3-flash-preview	  High-speed semantic distillation & Vision/OCR.
**Logic Guard**	   gemini-3-pro-preview	    Adversarial reasoning with a 4000-token Thinking Budget.
**Neural Dump**	   gemini-2.5-flash-audio	  Real-time PCM audio streaming via the Live API.
**Visual Synth**	 gemini-2.5-flash-image	  Generative concept visualization for abstract ideas.

**Key API Implementations**
- **Thinking Config**: We utilize a high thinking budget for logical auditing to ensure the model explores complex reasoning paths before responding.
- **Search Grounding**: URL processing is grounded via Google Search to ensure real-time accuracy and citation-backed summaries.
- **Spatial Vectors**: The canvas uses semantic similarity to cluster nodes automatically.
