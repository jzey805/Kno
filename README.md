**Built by a solo developer in 25 days for the Google Gemini API Developer Competition.**

Kno moves beyond simple "bookmarking" to solve the digital "link graveyard" problem. It transforms chaotic signals—URLs, PDFs, and voice memos—into structured, audited, and internalized wisdom. Kno leverages the multi-model reasoning capabilities of the **Gemini 3 ecosystem** to create a spatial cognitive environment for the modern researcher.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

> Traditional productivity tools focus on **storage**. Kno focuses on **internalization**.

We believe that data is only useful if it is challenged, synthesized, and remembered. Kno acts as a cognitive partner that doesn't just save what you read—it forces you to think about it through **adversarial auditing** and **spatial mapping**.

## ✨ Core Features

**1. Neural Ingestion (The Feed)**
Capture high-velocity signals from anywhere.
- **Web Distillation**: Instant extraction of core insights from URLs using Search Grounding.
- **Multimodal Capture**: OCR for handwritten notes, screenshots, and complex PDF data extraction.
- **Neural Dump**: A "God Mode" input engine using the **Gemini Live API** to process real-time voice streams and visual frames simultaneously.

**2. Logic Guard (The Critic)**
Powered by **Gemini 3 Pro** with a dedicated **Thinking Budget**, Kno performs a "Trinity Audit" on every note:
- **Factual Accuracy**: Cross-referencing claims against real-time data.
- **Cognitive Balance**: Identifying confirmation bias, echo chambers, and skewed perspectives.
- **Logical Integrity**: Scanning for formal fallacies and structural flaws in arguments.

**3. Spatial Synthesis (The Canvas)**
A D3-powered infinite workspace where ideas interact physically.
- **The Collider**: Force-fuse two conflicting ideas to generate a new synthesis.
- **The Alchemy Engine**: Transform raw source notes into structured "Gold" assets.
- **Serendipity Sparks**: AI-driven discovery of non-obvious connections between disparate nodes in your library.

**4. Memory Lab (Forensics)**
Track the health of your "Second Brain" with predictive analytics.
- **Decay Prediction**: AI calculates your retention probability based on quiz performance and time elapsed.
- **Forensic Audits**: Deep scans to identify "memory gaps" and logical inconsistencies across your entire library.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Dynamic, AI-generated quizzes that evolve as you learn.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

Kno utilizes a sophisticated multi-model pipeline to balance speed and reasoning depth:

| System | Gemini Model | Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion** | `gemini-3-flash-preview` | High-speed semantic distillation & Vision/OCR. |
| **Logic Guard** | `gemini-3-pro-preview` | Adversarial reasoning with a 4000-token Thinking Budget. |
| **Neural Dump** | `gemini-2.5-flash-audio` | Real-time PCM audio streaming via the Live API. |
| **Visual Synth** | `gemini-2.5-flash-image` | Generative concept visualization for abstract ideas. |

### Key API Implementations

* **Thinking Config:** We utilize a high thinking budget for logical auditing to ensure the model explores complex reasoning paths before responding.
* **Search Grounding:** URL processing is grounded via Google Search to ensure real-time accuracy and citation-backed summaries.
* **Spatial Vectors:** The canvas uses semantic similarity to cluster nodes automatically.
